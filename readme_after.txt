>> Launching the Application <<

  * You can start OmniDictate using the shortcut created in your Start Menu.
  * If you selected the option during setup, a shortcut may also be on your Desktop.

>> First Use & Configuration <<

  * When you first run OmniDictate, it will use default settings.
  * Open the application window to configure:
      - Whisper Model Size (larger models are more accurate but slower)
      - VAD Sensitivity (Silence Threshold)
      - Typing Speed (Character Delay)
      - Global Hotkeys for Push-to-Talk and Stopping
      - Filter words (to ignore specific repeated phrases)
      - New Line voice commands
  * Settings are saved automatically when changed or when you close the app.

>> Important: Microphone Setup <<

  * For best results, ensure your microphone's sample rate is set to
    16000 Hz in Windows Sound settings (Recording > Your Mic > Properties > Advanced).

>> GPU Acceleration <<

  * If you have correctly installed the necessary NVIDIA components (Driver, CUDA Toolkit,
    cuDNN) and the matching CUDA-enabled PyTorch, OmniDictate will use your
    GPU automatically. Otherwise, it will use the CPU.
