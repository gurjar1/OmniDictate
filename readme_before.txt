 OmniDictate - Before You Install
--------------------------------------------------

Thank you for choosing OmniDictate!

Please review the following important points before proceeding:

>> Prerequisites <<

  * Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:
    This application requires the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
    (for Visual Studio 2015-2022, 64-bit version) to be installed
    on your system. If you don't have it, the application may fail to start.
    You can download it directly from Microsoft's website.

  * GPU Acceleration (Optional but Recommended):
    For the best performance, OmniDictate can use an NVIDIA GPU.
    This requires you to *separately* install:
      1. Compatible NVIDIA Graphics Drivers.
      2. The correct CUDA Toolkit version (check the project's README on GitHub).
      3. The corresponding cuDNN library (usually included with CUDA Toolkit).
      4. The CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch (see project's README).
    If these are not found, OmniDictate will automatically use the slower CPU mode.

>> Installation Notes <<

  * This installer will place OmniDictate in your Program Files directory
    and requires Administrator privileges.
  * It is recommended to close other applications before starting the installation.
